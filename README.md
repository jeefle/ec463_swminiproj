# EC463 Mini Project 1

This miniproject simulates a temperature and humidity monitor using an Android app as a controller to see simulated sensor values. This project demonstrates multiple skills including use of API's (Using Google Authentication and Firestore), a cloud datastore (Google Firestore), agile development along with other skills.


## Getting Started

To run the app on a live Android device, simply download the .apk file onto your device and "allow installation from unknown sources." 

To run the app on an emulator, download Android Studio and use the VCS function -> import from version control -> import from github and enter https://github.com/jeefle/ec463_swminiproj.git -> clone. 

This will clone the repository. After, click on Run, and run the app on an emulator (Android 21 and up)
